    <description># Amazon ECS CLI

The Amazon ECS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line tool for Amazon Elastic Container
Service (Amazon ECS) that provides high-level commands to simplify creating, updating, and
monitoring clusters and tasks from a local development environment. The Amazon ECS CLI supports
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a popular open-source tool for defining and
running multi-container applications. Use the CLI as part of your everyday development and testing
cycle as an alternative to the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

For more information about Amazon ECS, see the [Amazon ECS Developer
Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified client for AWS services that provides commands
for all public API operations. These commands are lower level than those provided by the Amazon ECS
CLI. For more information about supported services and to download the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command
Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/) product detail page.
